As a **front-end engineer**, I have **abundant experience** working with **JavaScript**, **React.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Next.js**. I specialize in using **React hooks** to manage state and avoid the need for external libraries like Redux. With a deep understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of front-end development, I excel at creating visually stunning and **highly functional** user interfaces. My attention to detail and ability to communicate effectively with designers, developers, and other stakeholders make me an **excellent team player**.
